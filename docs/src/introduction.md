# Introduction
We chose exercise category A: compilation. As there were two of us in the group, we decided to use imperative and object-oriented languages as our "destination" languages. We chose Rust as the imperative language and Javascript as the object-oriented one. Each of these programs were implemented and can be compiled as source-to-source from MiniImp and tested on the command line with commands provided later.

The MiniImp version of the program can be found in the file main.rs as a variable called ```test```. It's implementation follows the exercise description.
