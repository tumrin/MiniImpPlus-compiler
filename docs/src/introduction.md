# Introduction

We chose exercise category A: compilation. As there were two of us in the group,
we decided to use imperative and object-oriented languages as our "destination" languages.
We chose Rust as the imperative language and Javascript as the object-oriented one.
Each of these programs were implemented and can be compiled as source-to-source
from MiniImpPlus and tested on the command line with commands provided later.

The MiniImpPlus test program can be found in project root in ```testprogram.mip```-file.
It's implementation follows the exercise description.
